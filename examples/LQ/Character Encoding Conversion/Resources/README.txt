Each file in this folder contains a short phrase in a particular language,
stored using a particular encoding. The files are named like this:

    <language>.<encoding>

For example, to properly decode "Thai.tis-620", you must use the TIS-620
codec. However, to properly decode "Thai.utf-8", you must use the UTF-8
codec.
