SVG Zoom and Scroll
===================

Prerequisite knowledge/experience
---------------------------------
- Basic LabVIEW programming
- Example _[3b. Connecting a Signal to a LabVIEW Event]
  (../Hello World - Introduction to Widgets/Source/3b. Connecting a Signal to a LabVIEW Event)_
  from the "Hello World - Introduction to Widgets" series


Description
-----------
This example displays an SVG image and lets you change its magnification, to
demonstrate the smoothness of vector graphics at different zoom levels. It also
showcases a user-defined scroll area, which is useful for containing a scene
that is too large to fit on the screen (e.g. an SVG image that's magnified 20x).
