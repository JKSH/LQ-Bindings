1. Constructing and Using a Widget
==================================

Prerequisite knowledge/experience
---------------------------------
- Basic LabVIEW programming


Description
-----------
Widgets are versatile building blocks for GUIs. Each widget can act as a
standalone window (just like a VI's front panel), or it can be embedded into a
larger widget (just like a control/indicator) to create a complex GUI.

This example simply contains one standalone widget. Later examples will show
you how to compose a GUI using multiple widgets.


Instructions
------------
1. Run _1. Main.vi_ and watch the LCD widget.
2. Use your mouse to resize the widget.
3. Click "Stop".
